I am currently working remotely as a Plumber of Data Science* a.k.a Data Engineer for a Germany based marketing company. Interesting journey so far. Love being part of the amazing, hardworking and fun team. Also contributed to Jenkins for some time (not much to be honest but enough to make it to Arctic Code Vault Contributor), amazing community and people, very welcoming.

#ThanksForHelp
Just want to put it out there, I wish I could thank a lot of random people who went out of the way to help, support and guide me. People I found on medium blogs, linkedin, women tech groups, seniors, stackoverflow community, reddit threads etc. I hope I can do the same for other random people. From answering stupid questions, posting and engaging with related posts, giving some mature advice, sharing blogs, links to my questions, just thank you. Every single thing was super helpful.

#OfferToHelp
If you are uncertain about your place in tech world, always doubtful if you will ever be good enough, struggling with self confidence, feel overwhelmed by men dominated field, do not apply for jobs because it says 2 years experience and you have only 1, are/have been bullied, have worked in a toxic work environment, have been underpaid and overworked, and you are a woman, muslim, asian and still love tech to the core. PLEASE DO NOT FEEL ALONE. Been there and done that. You can do this too. Drop me a message and I would be happy to talk to you. :) 

As an engineer,I hope this article reaches more people. I hope every person in my circles can have a better perspective of themselves and the world around them.
